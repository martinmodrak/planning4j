#summary How to validate plans with Planning4J

= Introduction =

The validation is accesible through IValidator interface. As of now, the only supported implementation is a Java wrapper to [http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/andrew/planning/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=70&Itemid=77 VAL validator], which is included in binary form for both Windows (compiled with CygWin) and Linux.


= Maven dependency =

There is a separate artifact for VAL validator (> 11 MB!)

{{{
        <dependency>
            <groupId>cz.cuni.amis.planning4j.external</groupId>
            <artifactId>external-validation</artifactId>
        </dependency>            
}}}

= Usage =

Either use ValValidator class directly, or use Planning4JUtils.validate helper method (supports domain and problem provider translation). Before using the validator, it has to be extracted with ValValidator.extractAndPrepareValidator()

More documention will be (hopefully) added in the future.

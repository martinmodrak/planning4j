/**
 * <p>A simple abstraction over PDDL objects to represent them in Java. It is to be extended to
 * be closer to actual object model, so that planners could manipulate those objects directly
 * and save time with translation to/from PDDL string.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Classes in this packages should also simplify generation of PDDL from your Java code.

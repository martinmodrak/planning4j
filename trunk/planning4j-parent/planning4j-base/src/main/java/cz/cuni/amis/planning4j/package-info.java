/**
 * This package contains main interfaces to communicate with Planning4J. 
 * Planning4J core consists of planners, domain and problem representations and translators.
 * A planner is connected to a particular domain and problem representation, there are however
 * translators that can translate between some kinds of representations. Helper methods in class
 * {@link cz.cuni.amis.planning4J.utils.Planning4JUtils} discover translators automatically as needed.
